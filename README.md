This repo contains our `slipsomat` script for pulling and pushing files to Alma
using Selenium browser automation. The script computes and stores checksums of
all the letters to protect you from overwriting the work of others.

Huh?!? Using something like Selenium for synchronizing files might seem like a
rather silly approach. It is! It worksâ€¦ sort-of, but we'd much prefer that
Ex Libris implemented a proper protocol we could use, so please go and vote for
[this idea](http://ideas.exlibrisgroup.com/forums/308173-alma/suggestions/12471084-synchronizing-xsl-templates-with-external-systems) on Ideas
Exchange to put some pressure on Ex Libris to do just that.

## Setup

You will need Python 2.7 or 3.3 or later. Install using `python setup.py install`,
or `pip install -e . ` if you plan to hack on the script and want an *editable install*.

Once installed, you can run `slipsomat` from any directory containing a `slipsomat.cfg`
file. To get started with your own files, you can create an empty directory with a
`slipsomat.cfg` with the following contents:

```
[login]
auth_type=SAML
domain=
instance=
institution=
username=
password=

[selenium]
browser=firefox
```

where you fill in the blank values.

* `auth_type=SAML` means you authenticate using a SAML provider such as Feide
  or Shibboleth. Set it to `auth_type=basic` to use the standard Alma login.
* `domain` is your Feide domain, e.g. `uio.no`. If you don't use Feide as your
  SAML provider, you can leave this empty.
* `instance` is the Alma instance name, which is the first part of your ALMA URL.
  If your Alma URL is `bibsys-k.alma.exlibrisgroup.com`, then `bibsys-k` is the
  instance name.
* `institution` the Alma institution name, e.g. `47BIBSYS_UBO`
* `username` is your username.
* `password` can be left blank if you want to be asked for it each time. This
  is the recommended solution, since the password is stored in plain text.
* `browser` can be set to `firefox`, `chrome` or `phantomjs`. The corresponding
  driver must be installed (GeckoDriver for Firefox, ChromeDriver for Chrome).
  I've not had so much success with PhantomJS, but both Firefox and Chrome works
  well most of the time, but browser updates sometimes cause Selenium to crash.
  Updating both Selenium and the driver(s) often help in that case.

## Debugging

If you have `inquirer` installed (does not work on Windows), slipsomat will give
you some options for starting a debug session if the script crashes.

## Getting started

The `slipsomat` command will give you an interactive shell where you can type various
commands. Type `help` for an overview.

To get started in an empty directory, type `pull` to pull in all the XSLT files from your Alma
instance and store them in a folder named `xsl` (will be created if not there already).
Optionally, type `defaults` to pull in all default letters too. Note that a `status.json` file
is also created. This holds the checksums for all the letters, allowing the script to easily keep
track of which files have been modified (locally or in Alma).

Once you have a directory with all your files you're free to put them under version control
if you like. Here's the repo we use for our files: https://github.com/scriptotek/alma-letters-ubo

## Workflow

In a workspace directory (a directory having a `slipsomat.cfg` file):

1. Start by doing `git pull` to pull in changes from other users.

2. `slipsomat` to start the script

3. Optional: the slipsomat command `pull` will check if any files have been updated
  directly in Alma (without using `slipsomat`), fetch those and update `status.json`.
  Comparison is done by comparing the update date in Alma with the update date in `status.json`.
  Alma does not provide time granularity for updates, only date, so for files that have been
  modified today, the script will open the letter in Alma to get the text and calculate a
  checksum to compare with the checksum in `status.json`.
  Note: If you skip this step, `slipsomat` will still warn you if you try to push a
  letter that have been modified remotely (checksums not matching), but then you will
  have to merge manually.

4. After having made modifications to one or more letters, run the slipsomat command `push`
  to push the updates to Alma. Comparison is done by comparing checksums of the local files
  with the checksums in `status.json`. Before making any changes, the script will print a list
  of files and confirm that you want to upload these.

5. After having tested the modifications, do a `git commit` (remember to include the updated
  `status.json`) and `git push`

The shell has a command history, and tab completion. For example `test Ful<tab><tab>`.

### Updating default letters

- Use the `slipsomat` command `defaults` to pull in all default letters.
  Note that the command takes quite some time to run, since all letters have to
  be checked as Alma provides no information whatsoever on when the default
  letters were last updated.

## Development

Given that you have created a `slipsomat.cfg` file, here's how to start
experimenting:

```python
from selenium.webdriver.common.by import By
from selenium.webdriver.support.ui import WebDriverWait
from selenium.webdriver.support import expected_conditions as EC
from selenium.webdriver.common.keys import Keys
from slipsomat.slipsomat import Browser, TemplateTable

# We set a quite short timeout (3 seconds) since we don't want to wait
# a long time every time we write a wrong selector.
browser = Browser('slipsomat.cfg', default_timeout=3)

# Open Browser and login using credentials from slipsomat.cfg
browser.connect()

table = TemplateTable(browser)
letter = table.rows[0]
letter.view_default()

wait = browser.waiter()
# Try looking for some element and click it
element = wait.until(EC.element_to_be_clickable((By.XPATH, '//button[@aria-label="Open Alma configuration"]')))
element.click()


```
